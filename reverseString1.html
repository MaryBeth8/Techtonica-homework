	a) If you want to loop through an array in reverse using the incrementation method, what index of the array does the variable i need to start as? How do we write this in code?

	b) If we are looping through an array in reverse, what value does i need to be for the loop to terminate?

	c) How do we increment or decrement i if we are looping through an array in reverse?
