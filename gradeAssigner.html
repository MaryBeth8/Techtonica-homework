	// The Incredible Automatic Grade Assigner!

	// Write a function called gradeAssigner. 

	function gradeAssigner(studentScores) {

		var studentScores = [];

		switch (studentScores) {

			case 

		}


	}

	// The function should have a parameter called studentScores, which is a placeholder for an argument  that should be passed in as an array. This array should consist of only numbers, which represent a grade out of 100 on a science test. eg: [89, 71, 63, 95, 58]

	// Use a switch statement to print a letter grade for each percent in studentScores as follows:

	// 90 and above gets an A
	// 80 and above gets a B
	// 70 and above gets a C
	// 60 and above gets a D
	// anything below 60 gets an F

	// Remember to call your function and pass in the proper parameter!
